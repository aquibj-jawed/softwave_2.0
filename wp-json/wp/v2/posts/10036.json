By automating payment processing and reconciliation tasks, digital payment platforms streamline administrative workflows, reduce manual errors, and free up valuable time and resources that can be reinvested into delivering exceptional dining experiences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Access to a Global Marketplace<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With digital payments, the world is your oyster \u2013 quite literally.
